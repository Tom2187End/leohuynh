## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Tuan Anh (Leo)

I like coding, I do stuff related to Web development, I work mainly with **React/Node** and **Pure Javascript**. Now I'm focusing on developing **Shopify's apps and themes**.

I'm an ex Coding Instructor at [MindX Technology & Startup School](https://mindx.edu.vn/) (aka Techkids).

Ex Fullstack Developer at [PageFly](https://apps.shopify.com/pagefly) (Top 3 page builder app on **Shopify** app store).

Ex Frontend Engineer at [Coc Coc](https://coccoc.com/) - **#1** web browser in **Viet Name** with more than **25M users**.

See more about my working experiences at [my resume](/resume).

## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning! <Twemoji emoji="smiling-face-with-sunglasses" />

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

In addition, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a software engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment on what I wrote <Twemoji emoji="folded-hands" />
