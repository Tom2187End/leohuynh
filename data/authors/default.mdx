## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Tuan Anh (Leo)

I'm an ex Coding Instructor at [MindX Technology & Startup School](https://mindx.edu.vn/) (aka Techkids).

Ex Fullstack Developer at [PageFly](https://apps.shopify.com/pagefly) (Top 3 page builder app on **Shopify** app store).

Currently a Shopify Software Engineer in an awesome team at [Insights Studio](https://insights.is/).

## Why have this blog?

This is where I note and share my pieces of knowledge about programming, work, and life of a software developer.

I write to improve myself, to learn how to present a problem, have a deep understanding of it, and share it with ones who need.

All the know-how and opinions that I got through my monitor are my personal point of view, and it would be highly appreciated if I could hear your thought about my write.

Happy hacking ðŸ¤˜!
