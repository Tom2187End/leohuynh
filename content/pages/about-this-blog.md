### Why have this blog?

This is where I note and share my pieces of knowledge about programming, work, and the life of a software developer.

I write to improve myself, to learn how to present a problem, have a deep understanding of it, and share it with ones who need.

All the opinions are from my personal point of view so I would ‚ù§Ô∏è to hear yours, and pls consider before applying them to you cause that‚Äôs all the experiences I got through my monitor.

Happy hacking ü§ò!
