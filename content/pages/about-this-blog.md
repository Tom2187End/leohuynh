### Why have this blog?

This is where I note and share my pieces of knowledge about programming, work, and life of a software developer.

I write to improve myself, to learn how to present a problem, have a deep understanding of it, and share it with ones who need.

All the know-how and opinions that I got through my monitor are my personal point of view, and it would be highly appreciated if I could hear your thought about my write.

Happy hacking ðŸ¤˜!
