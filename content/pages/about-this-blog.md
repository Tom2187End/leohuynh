### Credit

This blog built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), using [Gatsby Starter Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen).

A huge thanks to [Alexander Shelepenok
](https://github.com/alxshelepenok) for the minimal, lightweight and super easy-to-customize blog starter.


My blog is not the [original version](https://lumen.netlify.com) of this starter, I've added many things to personalize it (You can find my version [here](https://github.com/hta218/leo-blog))
